            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I applied Genetic Algorithms (GA) to develop an AI agent capable of playing the classic Pac-Man game more effectively. The goal was to optimize the agent's performance by evolving a set of parameters that govern its decision-making process, ultimately enhancing its ability to navigate the game, avoid ghosts, and consume food.</p>

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <h3>1. Genetic Algorithm Application</h3>
            <p>The core of this project involves using a Genetic Algorithm to fine-tune the behaviour of the Pac-Man agent. Genetic Algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. In this project, the GA was employed to evolve a population of potential solutions (chromosomes), where each chromosome represents a different set of parameters for the Pac-Man agent.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Agent Design</h3>
            <p>The Pac-Man agent's behaviour is governed by a set of parameters encoded in a chromosome. Each chromosome is an array of values that determine the agent's strategies for various aspects of the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Avoiding dangerous ghosts</li>
                <li>2. Seeking and consuming food</li>
                <li>3. Targeting scared ghosts when they are vulnerable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The agent's effectiveness is evaluated based on its game score, which serves as the fitness function in the GA.</p>

            <h3>3. Evolution Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> A population of chromosomes is randomly generated.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Each chromosome is tested by running the Pac-Man game, and its performance is assessed based on the final score achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>Selection:</strong> The best-performing chromosomes are selected based on their fitness scores.</li>
                <li><strong>Crossover:</strong> Pairs of chromosomes are combined to produce offspring, combining traits from both parents.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Random changes are introduced to offspring chromosomes to maintain genetic diversity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Results</h3>
            <p>After running the genetic algorithm, the agentâ€™s performance improved as it adapted to better handle various game scenarios. The final optimized chromosome values were hardcoded into the agent for practical use.</p>

            <h3>5. Visualization</h3>
            <p>The project includes a visual representation of the GA's progress over generations. A plot was generated to show how the best fitness score evolved, demonstrating the improvement in the agent's performance over time.</p>
