            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my Neural-Network Driving Game! This project was created using Python, featuring a racing game where a car learns to drive on a track using a custom-built neural network and a genetic algorithm. Unlike many other projects that rely on machine learning libraries, I implemented the neural network from scratch using NumPy, which gave me deeper control over how the network operates and evolves.</p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <h3>1. Genetic Algorithm-Driven Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The core innovation in this game is the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to train the car's neural network to navigate the track. The GA simulates the process of natural selection, gradually evolving better-performing neural network "chromosomes" (sets of weights and biases) over hundreds of generations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Hard-Coded Neural Network</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, I manually built the neural network using NumPy. The network has one hidden layer with a custom number of nodes, and it uses <strong>tanh</strong> activation functions to produce decisions for steering and acceleration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Three Driving Agents</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keyboard Agent:</strong> Manual driving using keyboard inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Agent:</strong> A basic hand-coded algorithm controls the car based on its position on the track.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Agent:</strong> The neural network agent improves over time through genetic algorithm training.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The car tries to drive around a randomly generated track without crashing. It starts at a designated point and uses steering and speed controls to stay on track.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Network:</strong> Takes in inputs like the car's position relative to the track, orientation, distance travelled, and other factors. It processes this through a hidden layer and outputs controls for steering and speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetic Algorithm:</strong> Generates initial random chromosomes (neural network weights and biases), tests them, and selects the best-performing ones to evolve over generations.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Custom Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Track Layout:</strong> The track includes curves and straight sections for a challenging driving experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> The car must stay within the track bounds, or it will crash and reset.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphical Display:</strong> The game uses Pygame for real-time graphics, showing the track and car's movements.</li>

            <h3>Why This Project is Unique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No External Libraries for Neural Networks:</strong> The neural network is built from scratch using NumPy, providing deeper control over the learning process.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Learning:</strong> The genetic algorithm optimizes the neural network without backpropagation, learning through mutation and natural selection.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Visualization:</strong> The learning process is visualized in real-time as the car improves its performance with each generation.</li>
