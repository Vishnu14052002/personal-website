            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>In this project, I developed a sophisticated climate prediction model using the Colchester weather dataset, which spans from January 2022 to December 2022. The goal was to forecast weather conditions for the next 24 hours with high accuracy by employing a range of machine learning and neural network techniques.</p>

            <h3>Data Pre-processing</h3>
            <p>Effective data pre-processing was crucial for building an accurate predictive model. Here's a summary of the pre-processing steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Handling Null Values:</strong> I addressed missing data in the dataset by employing the interpolation polynomial method, which helped estimate and fill missing values based on the trend of existing data points.</li>
                <li><strong>Label Encoding:</strong> Categorical features were converted into numerical values using label encoding, facilitating their use in machine learning models.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Splitting:</strong> The dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation sets to ensure effective model training and evaluation on unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> Various visualizations were performed to better understand the dataset, uncovering patterns and trends that informed the modeling process.</li>
